            <p>Clarksville, Tenn., July 24th 1880.</p>
            <p>Dr. J.G.M. Ramsey:</p>
            <p>Dear Sir,</p>
            <p>I am preparing a history of Montgomery County, and desire to ask some information of you, if you will not consider it an imposition.</p>
            <p>Among the early Stations upon the Cumberland, was one called &quot;Kilgore&apos;s,&quot; which I believe to have been subsequently known as <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">&quot;Maulding&apos;s.&quot;</unclear> In the map accompanying your &quot;Annals,&quot; you seem to locate this Station in Red River, about midway between Clarksville and Port Royal, while Putnam, in his &quot;History of Middle Tennessee,&quot; places it &quot;on the head-waters of Red river, near the cross-Plains, in Robertson County.&quot; If you have any information by which its locality can be identified I would be very thankful to you for it.</p>
            <p>In the course of my investigation I have become much inter-</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="0012_000060_000469_0003.jpg" xml:id="d3e191"/>
            <p>ested in Col. Valentine Sevier, who died in this County in the year 1800, and I would like to know more of him. I take the liberty of sending you a copy of the Tobacco Leaf, containing a notice of him which I had published, principaly for the purpose of awakening an interest in the early times here, as a means of gaining informations. There is none of his family in the County now that I know of. His son John, who seems to have been a favorite of the Governors, administered on his estate, but what ever because of him I know not.</p>
            <p>With great respect,</p>
            <p>I am your able Serv&apos;t</p>
