            <p>Dr. J.G.M. Ramsey,</p>
            <p>Knoxville,</p>
            <p>Tennessee.</p>

            <p>Madison, Apr. 22nd 1876.</p>
            <p>My Dear Doctor Ramsey --</p>
            <p>I think of you often -- but write seldom. Have a selfish inquiry to make -- though I may have heretofore made it:</p>
            <p>About a Col. Elijah Isaacs, who figured prominently in Burke Co. N.C. during &amp; after the Revolution -- &amp; finally floated off West -- I suppose to Tennessee. I wish to learn about him. Have you any knowledge or tradition of such a man? He was an active officer in the Revn., &amp; much in the N.C. legislature -- &amp; wd. be a man of some mark wherever he went, I wd. suppose.</p>
            <p>I wrote the late Gov. Graham, </p>
            <pb n="3" facs="0012_000060_000433_0003.jpg" xml:id="d3e181"/>
            <p>but he knew nothing of him.</p>
            <p>In writing a few days ago abt. Gen. Evan Shelby, I notice Haywood &amp; you both state he was made a Brig. Genl. by Virginia: Col. Todd (son-in-law of <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">Jc</unclear> Shelby -- in his Shelby memoir on the Portrail Gallery days after the Va. &amp; N.C. boundary line was extended in 1779-80, Evan Shelby was forced to reside in N.C., &amp; was then made Brig. Gen. -- Evidently by Gov. Nash of N.C., &amp; hence, I infer, <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR"> Jc.</unclear> Shelby in Same County, was advanced to Colonel. See if you can trip up this way of putting the matter.</p>
            <p>My Mecklenburg is packed on the shelf -- can&apos;t get a publisher to take hold of it on his risk; &amp; I hesitate to involve myself in getting before the public, as such monographs are not likely to attract only a select attention.</p>
            <p>God bless you!</p>
            <p>Ever Truly Yours,</p>
            <p>Lyman C. Draper.</p>
            <p>Do you know any of the name of Isaacs in Tenn? <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR"> Jaeb.</unclear> B. Isaacs, M.C., was a Pennsylvanian -- &amp; so wd. not do. Your Judge Heiskell might know.</p>
