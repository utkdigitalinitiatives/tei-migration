            <p>Mrs. Margaret C. Ramsey,</p>
            <p>My Dear Friend,</p>
            <p>I send to you by the mail to-day a copy of the &quot;Northern Whig,&quot; a newspaper printed in Belfast, Ireland and which contains the proceedings of the Scotch Irish Review held in that city a few weeks ago. I had hoped to attend the meeting, to which I was kindly invited by Dr. Martin, but an inability to leave home this summer deprived me of that pleasure. As soon as I read the proceedings, the thought occurred, with what delight would my good friend, now no more on earth, one who though dead is never absent from your thoughts, have enjoyed the perusal of facts set forth in the several speeches concerning the Scotch Irish people who settled in America. I send the paper to you and I know it will interest you, and <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR"> Wendy</unclear>. I am glad that the occasion gives me the opportunity of again writing to you.</p>
            <p>The correspondence which for some years was carried on between your late venerable husband and myself was, indeed, a real pleasure. <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">His</unclear> letters, though they <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">quesenathy</unclear> bore upon the business of the Society, were not <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">invited</unclear> with</p>
