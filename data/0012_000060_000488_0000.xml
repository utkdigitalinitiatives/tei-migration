            <p>Dr. J.G.M. Ramsey,</p>
            <p>My Dear Sir:</p>
            <p>The receipt of your precious letter of the 18th <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">has</unclear> acted as a <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">tonic</unclear> to me, and I read the familiar <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">writing</unclear> with a <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">zest</unclear> that was truly refreshing. My wife, also, enjoyed it exceedingly. We are very much gratified to know that you are better, and we trust you will continue to improve.</p>
            <p>What a delightful time you must have had on Saturday last, celebrating your 85th birthday! How we wish we could have been with you! Those present must have enjoyed the occasion. Long may you live! And you will too; And when you leave this world you will enter into the next with</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="0012_000060_000488_0003.jpg" xml:id="d3e198"/>
            <p>your youth renewed, and all your intellectual faculties in full vigor.</p>
            <p>Shall we know each other there? Of course we will. If Peter nand James and John, on the moment of Transfiguration, could recognize Moses and Elijah, one of whom had been in Heaven for fifteen hundred years, the other nine hundred, what is to hinder us from recognizing each other? It is a delightful thought.</p>
            <p>But I write you a line this morning to congratulate you upon your passing the eighty-fifth mile post in the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">journey</unclear> of life, and to say that my wife and I send our love and good wishes to you and Mrs. Ramsey and all your family. Your wife has kept you alive, by the aid of our Heavenly Father, for these many years, and she will receive a bright crown for all her works of faith and labors of love, in the Kingdom of eternal glory.</p>
            <p>Praying that you may remain with us for many years to come,</p>
            <p>I remain yours,</p>
            <p>Very sincerely,</p>
            <p>Anson Nelson</p>
