            <p>Huntersville, N.C.</p>
            <p>Dear Aunt,</p>
            <p>It is my sad duty to write to you of Aunt Sue&apos;s death which occurred at ten oclock last night (Sunday).</p>
            <p>On account of Pa&apos;s sickness, none of us could be with her but I think she died easy.</p>
            <p>We were at the funeral today, it was preached at home &amp; she was buried at Hopewell church.</p>
            <p>She looked very much like she did when alive.</p>
            <p>Uncle Dave asked me to write to-night so you all could hear sooner.</p>
            <p>Grace took her Mamma&apos;s death very hard, dont know what she will do now, she depended so</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="0012_000060_000549_0003.jpg" xml:id="d3e191"/>
            <p>on Aunt Sue in everything.</p>
            <p>Little <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">Lalinus</unclear> &amp; Will seemed broken hearted.</p>
            <p>Pa is slowly improving but is not able to sit up at all, he is greatly distrissed about Aunt Sue&apos;s death. You know she was the only relative he had in North Carolina.</p>
            <p>I cannot write a very long letter as I have a very bad headache.</p>
            <p>
               <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">Iffr Arr</unclear> who preached the funeral had to preach one for three other people. That will show you something of the amount of sickness around here.</p>
            <p>I will close hoping to hear from you soon &amp; sympathising with you.</p>
            <p>Your affectionate niece,</p>
            <p>Annette Ramsey</p>
            <p>Monday eve,</p>
