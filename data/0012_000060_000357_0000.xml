            <p>Dr. Alexander&apos;s</p>
            <p>Tuesday Evening Nov. 11, 1828</p>
            <p>Dear Wife</p>
            <p>If all my letters arrive safe at Mecklinburg you will think I write often enough however little
worthy of your attention I communicate - But as your letters to me have miscarried I fear the same fate
may have attended mine to you &amp; I therefore take this method by Cousin J.M. Wallis to tell you in 
a few words that on the whole my health is improving I think - &amp; that if I could forget one melancholy
instance of the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">instability</unclear> of all human &amp;
<unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">sublunary</unclear> enjoyments I would <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">pass</unclear> my <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">time</unclear>
though absent from you &amp; any home even pleasantly - Today I spent in <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">Charlotte</unclear> - a place you know with me of some notoriety - I saw Mr. Polk from
Tennessee - who politely showed me Cornwallis&apos; head-quarters - the grave-yard of his soldiers &amp;c - Tell
the Col. L.R.C.C. that I <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">went about among</unclear> the vast crowds
that frequent a N.C. court on Tuesday giving an attentive ear to what was saying by <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">those</unclear> of Genl. Jackson - Two Adams <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">electors</unclear>
were on the ground &amp; no one of the Jackson Ticket but 2 or 3 to one were evidently in favor of our</p>

            <p>candidate. There is no need to enlarge here on this topic - but I cannot keep from attending the
election Thursday next - </p>
            <p>Mr. Wallis I hope will stay one day at least with you - he is so home-sick that he could not be
prevailed on to rest but one day here - I ask him how he supposes I do who may be absent from home a month
or two or three yet? I answer to you I will do as well as I can. I know my duty to myself to my family
&amp; to my country requires the sacrifice &amp; I yield to the necessity of it with as much cheerfulness
as I can command &amp; perhaps with more than you suppose from some accidental expressions in my
letters - but I disguise nothing from you &amp; feeling when I write as if I were by you &amp; conversing
with you I perhaps come out with too little reserve in some places - You must not form erroneous conclusions
from such expressions - </p>
            <p>Our friends are all well &amp; are doing well - I find all of them are members of their Mother Church - The
Presbyterian - except Dr. Caldwell - who has had his little son baptised - even Uncle J.M.A. in his old
age has made a <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">profession</unclear>
            </p>

be on my way <gap resp="Dyson-Smith"/> before it takes place - My friends are <gap resp="Dyson-Smith"/> ions that I should stay longer
here <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">than</unclear> tended - but next Wednesday I shall set <gap resp="Dyson-Smith"/>
               <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">Campden</unclear> S.C. - against that <gap resp="Dyson-Smith"/> shall receive a letter

<unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">W. Alexander</unclear> Tuesday &amp; Wednesday I leave them for the

see - but those who <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">have</unclear> parents or can estimate parental
solicitude <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">will</unclear> overlook &amp; excuse it - </p>
