            <p>March 22 1865</p>
            <p>Dear Pa</p>
            <p>I have just got back from <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">Bristol</unclear> where 
<unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">I</unclear> have been for a week. <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">I</unclear>
went down for some of our boys that were absent without <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">leave.</unclear> I saw Gen.
Vaughn had a long <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">talke</unclear> with him about the state of the country, he is in
very good spirits. He told me he had seen <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">Sam Gunagum</unclear> just from Knoxville
told him Cro had been sent north, he had been right sick but had got well; John Kennedy <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">sm</unclear> of <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">Hrse</unclear> Kennedy of Knoxville left Knoxville on
<unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">Stu</unclear> South of <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">this rise with</unclear>
he said Cro was in the confederate hospital and the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">ladies</unclear> took him every
thing he wanted and was very well treated he had not</p>

            <p>been sent north when he <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">bef.</unclear> but <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">Gunagum</unclear> left there since he did. The report was when I left Bristol yesterday was that Gen. Thomas had
got to <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">Morristown</unclear> with about twenty thousand <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">troops</unclear> they cannot tell when then they are coming here or going to North Ga. I think he is
coming this way. I see that Gen Johnson has gave Sherman a whiping I hope he may destroy his whole army. Some of
<unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">our company</unclear> have been <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">paroled</unclear>
and are <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">home</unclear> we will go in to camps in a few days. I was in hope
I would get a letter when I got here but was disapointed. I have not <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">heard 
from</unclear> any of you since I <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">left</unclear>. I suppose it is
because <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">the sides are so unsertain and are so much delay as <gap resp="Dyson-Smith"/> count</unclear>
