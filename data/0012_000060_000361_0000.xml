            <p>Having nothing particular to communicate, I write to reciprocate that friendship manifested by your letter from
Charleston, - no occurences worthy of notice since you left us - have received no letter from Tennessee - We hope to
hear from you frequently - &amp; always of your increasing health &amp; enjoyments - in your present situation you
perhaps owe a duty to your Country which your talents enables you to <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">perform</unclear>, - in a cool dispationate way, to allay the unreasonable &amp; unpatriotic fervour
in So. C. - <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">a,</unclear> - arriving from misconception as to the nature &amp;
opperation of the tariff - </p>
            <p>A tariff is operative as a source of revenue to a certain entent - every tariff laid by Congress has opperated
as a <gap resp="Dyson-Smith"/> of productive revenue without <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">intranein<gap resp="Dyson-Smith"/>
               </unclear> price of
fabricks or <gap resp="Dyson-Smith"/> &amp;c prices of agricultural products - a <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">less</unclear>
importation of one article - leading to a more extensive importation of others will ever be the result of mercantile
speculation &amp; policy, the tariff is thus clearly a revenue law so far as yet developed, not in the least effecting
the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">shippers</unclear> or farmer, &amp; if its operation thus continues, it
must be constitutional, - according to their own principles - a modification in thus only proper. In commercial
regulations as in philosophy facts often prove things correct - which reason would prove absurb - e.g. -
<unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">hydrostatic pasad &amp;c</unclear> - circular card - or - tax on molasses,
glass, nails or - importing <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">foreigner</unclear> - must &amp; does bear the
loss - Should you have been to Colombia - please note your sucess as to your Tennessee road - I fear you will find
So. C.a. as it has ever been - always on the highest extremes - apathy or irritability prodigality - penury -
wisdom - folly - perfect despondency as in a Revolution. - or the morbid vigour &amp; energy of a Maniac, as
now - May health - prosperity, &amp; happiness accompany you</p>
