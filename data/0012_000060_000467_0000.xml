            <p>Madison, July 15th, 1880.</p>
            <p>My Dear Dr. Ramsey --</p>
            <p>Since I wrote you the other day, I recovered your mislaid letter about Parson Doak.</p>
            <p>Yesterday in writing up the route of the King&apos;s Mountain Men, I was struck with some of your statements -- <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">143:</unclear>
            </p>
            <p>1st You say 4th of Oct. when they reached Gilbert Town. I should hardly think you go that from Shelby&apos;s account because I find nothing to warrant it in the official report by the 3 Colonels -- not in Haywood, &amp; not in Shelby&apos;s acct. as dictated to Hardin. He does say abt. the 1st of Oct. in Haywood, they were joined by Cleveland -- &amp; two days after was raining, when they did not move, but held the council &amp; appointed Campbell, &amp; next mom-</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="0012_000060_000467_0003.jpg" xml:id="d3e182"/>
            <p>marched towards Gilbert Town, 16 or 18 miles away -- &amp; this would make it about the 4th Oct. But the official report signed by Campbell, Shelby, &amp; Cleveland, makes it 30th Sept. when Cleveland joined them -- hence it would have been the 3rd of Oct. they reached Gilbert Town. We mist not go behind the records, when we have any.</p>
            <p>On p. 233 of your History you speak of Ferguson&apos;s march over Broad river to the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR"> Cow pens</unclear> -- this would make him marching towards the west. I suppose, however, you meant Pacolet -- this you say was the 4th, &amp; next day he crossed at Dean&apos;s Ferry, &amp; camped about a mile above, &amp; the next day, the 6th he marched abt. 14 <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">ms</unclear> to King&apos;s Mtn.</p>
            <p>Where did you get these dates &amp; statements? It seems to me with the lights before me -- especially Col. Wm. Hill&apos;s <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">ms</unclear> (one of the S. Car. Cols.) that they are not reliable; &amp; Ferguson&apos;s letter to Lord Cornwallis, without date, indicates that he crossed Broad River, not at Dean&apos;s Ferry, but considerably below, at the Cherokee <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">Hand</unclear> -- that he marched along the road from Cherokee <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">Hand</unclear> leading north at Kings Mtn. He must have reached there at least as early as 4th Oct.</p>
            <p>Very Truly Yours,</p>
            <p>Lyman C. Draper.</p>
