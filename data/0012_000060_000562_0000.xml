            <p>My dear Mrs. Breck:-</p>
            <p>I loaned my &quot;tree&quot; to Mr. Sharpe of Nashville &amp; have just gotten it home. I have made a rough sketch of your branch of the family, which I am sending you, hoping it will give you pleasure. The next time I go to Nashville, will see if I can get some paper, such as the Architects use, &amp; sketch the whole tree for you. James Alexander is the founder of the N.C. branch</p>

            <p>the tree does not give the date of his birth - or the name of his wife. I wrote to Bessie Caldwell, (now Mrs. Archibald Young) of Charlotte, N.C. She is a grand daughter of Rev. Samuel Chraighead Caldwell - She was just moving into a new home &amp; said as soon as she was settled would write to me. Said Charlotte was the place to find out all about the Alexanders - </p>
            <p>When I hear from her will write you what she says -</p>
            <p>The following is a list of the children of James Alexander</p>

            <p>They did not believe in <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">name</unclear> suicide in those days - </p>
            <p>I wrote to Mrs. Minnis, the great</p>

            <p>grand daughter of Adam Alexander who settled in Washington Ga. She says he had no brothers or sisters, &amp; left only one son Adam L. Alexander. He came to this country as the Revolution broke out - had just graduated at the University of Edinburg Scotland. Her grandfather went to Yale, &amp; married a Miss Glibert there.</p>
            <p>Adam seems to have been a family name - &amp; I think her father must be a descendent of the same <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">strock</unclear>.</p>

            <p>All I find out in regard to the family, will let you know.</p>
            <p>If you will place the sketch of the tree I send over white paper, you can see it more plainly.</p>
            <p>With love, &amp; best wishes</p>
