            <p>Madison May 21st, 1874.</p>
            <p>My Dear Dr. Ramsey --</p>
            <p>I wrote you hastily this morning -- so as to hurry off to you the Circular you denied.</p>
            <p>You mention that Wheeler in his Hist. of N.C. states that Capt. Craighead was on Rutherford&apos;s campaign. I have looked to find such a record -- but my eye fails to discover it.</p>
            <p>If you set your eye on it again, cite me to it. I suspect you refer to Hanging Rock -- Wheeler, 11, 194? -- </p>
            <pb n="2" facs="0012_000060_000420_0002.jpg" xml:id="d3e168"/>
            <p>I am only making good progress in the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LM">sinister</unclear> work in perfecting my materials.</p>
            <p>Where in N.C. did you make the acquaintance with Ex--Gov. Graham of Greensboro? The late Gov. Swain had Gov. Davies&apos; Ms -- as you see in Wheeler&apos;s N.C., giving accts. of Rocky Mount &amp; Hanging Rock. Ms. Swain accorded me permission to have copies taken -- through Judge Battle, when it was found Gov. Swain had loaned the Davie Ms. to Gov. Graham -- &amp; he kindly promised Judge Battle, &amp; afterwards Col. Wm. Johnston that the wd. have a transcript made &amp; sent me. This a year ago or more. I wrote Gov. Graham again in <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LM">Hale.port</unclear> I hear nothing. I think his intentions are good. But I really wish a full and accurate transcript -- Wm. Wheeler gives in the main probably, yet I know that some things are <unclear reason="illegible" resp="LM"> omitted</unclear>.</p>
            <p>Send me newspaper accts. of yr. society&apos;s meetings &amp; progress.</p>
            <p>Yours truly -- Lyman C. Draper</p>
