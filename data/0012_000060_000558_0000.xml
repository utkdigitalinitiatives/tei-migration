            <p>January 16th, 1905</p>
            <p>Dear Mrs Breck:</p>
            <p>Your letter was received in due time.</p>
            <p>I hope you will give the Jackson letters to the Historical Society, and in time give also your copy of Ramsey&amp;s Annals.</p>
            <p>We will prize the gift and thank you for it.</p>
            <p>U have delightful recollections of your honored father. I was his friend before I ever saw him, Mrs Porter&apos;s father, and uncles The &quot;<unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">Dunlop</unclear>boys&quot; as he called them were friends of his from boyhood.</p>

            <p>The splendid portrait of your father, painted by Branson, The Knoxville artist, was executed at my suggestion, and contributed to the Historical Society by Col. <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">Chass</unclear>McGhee. When he died, I took about a dozen members of the Society to Knoxville, we attended his funeral and witnessed the interment of his remains at his old home. I am pleased to know that you preserve interest in the Historical Society, and I hope that all of your father&apos;s descendants will maintain interest in a work so greatly honored by him.</p>
            <p>Sincerely Yours</p>
            <p>Jas. D. Porter</p>
