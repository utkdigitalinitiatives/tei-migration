               <note type="abstract">In this letter dated December 26, 1870, from Col. William Johnston in Charlotte, N.C., to J.G.M. Ramsey, in Salisbury, N.C., he replys to Mr. Ramsey&apos;s request for employment by asking that he sell railroad bonds, write articles publicizing the railroad for newspapers in cities from New York to New Orleans, and help the writer with his correspondence. He reports that there is no position as an official of the railroad worthy of J.G.M.&apos;s talents.</note>
