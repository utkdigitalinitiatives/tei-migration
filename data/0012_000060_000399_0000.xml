               <note type="abstract">Lyman C. Draper wrote this letter to J.G.M. Ramsey on April 22, 1871. He told him about his upcoming travel plans in Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Florida, North and South Carolina, Virginia, and Washington. He told Ramsey of his plans to visit Col. Thomas Taylor&apos;s son in Louisiana. Draper also mentioned plans to stop by the Georgia Historical Society to examine Gen. James Jackson&apos;s papers and to visit Col. Sam Hammond&apos;s son in Charleston. Taylor, Jackson, and Hammond had served with Thomas Sumter during the American Revolution. He planned to examine a South Carolina Gazette file, while in Charles, and to visit some Sumter relatives while in South Carolina. He still had no plans to visit Knoxville. He had not decided to move to the South due to finances. He felt he would be better off timewise and financially in Wisconsin so as to continue his historical work. He had considered possibly moving to St. Augustine. </note>

            <p>Apl. 22d 1871</p>
            <p>My Dear Good Doctor-</p>
            <p>Your obliging favor gave me pleasure, as your letters always do. You have good old fashioned way of throwing your heart, full of generous impulses, into your letters - always so genial &amp; charming. </p>
            <p>I have carefully studied up my route - &amp; deem it best to take North Carolina on my return - so I shall scarcely expect to reach Charlotte by the last of <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">nine</unclear> - &amp; this is mere guess-work. I shall make brief calls at two or three places in South Western </p>
            <p>
               <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">That</unclear> Helping Hand book, got so tied up immediately after it was issued, in a law suit yet <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">feuding </unclear>, in consequence of the break-up of the publishing firm that I have been unable to get my copies scince the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">Lus</unclear>I first got &amp; sent to sorters. </p>
            <pb n="2" facs="0012_000060_000399_0002.jpg" xml:id="d3e183"/>
            <p>Kentucky - at, Paris, Castalian Springs, Columbia &amp; Pulaski, Tenn - at Florence, Ala - &amp; then go direct to Shreveport, La to see the only surviving son of Col. Ths. Taylor, Sumter&apos;s <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">right Laced</unclear>Colonel - the son nearly 93 years old: Then I shall steer back- <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">paming </unclear> through <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">hein </unclear> &amp; &amp; Alabama, making some three calls - at Elyton, Talladega <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">&amp;Eutaw</unclear>- thence into Georgia, calling at Decatur, Macon &amp; Savannah -at the letter in Ges. <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">Hirt. Soc. examing</unclear> Ms. papers of Gen Jas. Jackson who served under Sumter at Blackstock&apos;s - thence perhaps to St Augustine to see - then to Charleston, where beside seeing an aged son of Col. Sam. Hammond who served much with Sumter - <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">Iarih</unclear> particularly to examine thoroughly a file of the old S.C. Gazette commencing </p>
            <pb n="3" facs="0012_000060_000399_0003.jpg" xml:id="d3e210"/>
            <p>
               <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">wrtte</unclear> the capture of Des <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">Johnnes</unclear>by Sumter away the Cherokees, in 1762, till the close ofthe Revolution; - then go among the Sumter relatives, &amp; quite a number of places in So. Carolina - thence to Charlotte. <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">The</unclear> list looks formidable. I have some calls to make in Va &amp; if too much time is not sonsumed I wish to stop in Washington &amp; make some copies from <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">Peunion </unclear> office statements.</p>
            <p>I shall not think of going to Knoxville - on the whole - too much out ofthe way, &amp; too little prospect of getting anything of <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">moment. </unclear>
            </p>
            <p>As to settling in the South, I am greatly at a loss as to </p>
            <pb n="4" facs="0012_000060_000399_0004.jpg" xml:id="d3e235"/>
            <p>what I had best to do. The truth is, my means are too small to live there without engaging in some sort of business - &amp; if I so engage, I should be <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">auable</unclear> to go on with my historical labors. Here, even with broken health, I get my $1200 a year prompt pay &amp; do not devote more than one fourth of my time to the Histl. Society&apos;s interests - leaving a generous margin of time to myself. But I will make the best observations when South I can. My original idea was - if I <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">cd.</unclear> set hold of a place near St Augustine, with one or two hundred orange trees in bearing the surplus fruit wd. help me eke out a living. I do not want again, if I sh. <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">resuove</unclear> to engage in any sort of business making me in theleast dependant on others - or even seemingly so. </p>
            <p>I shall avoid by the route I have chosen, any necessity for a cicerone. That wd. imply, I think a sort of lionizing - &amp; I shrink from that - besides I am too small an animal to manufacture <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">intod lion</unclear>, even by implication. </p>
            <p>I <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">dengu</unclear> starting 1st. of May.-May Heaven kindly bless you &amp; yours!</p>
            <p>Very Sincerely - Lyman C. Draper</p>
