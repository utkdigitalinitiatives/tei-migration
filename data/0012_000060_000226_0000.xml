            <p>Knoxville Dec 18th</p>
            <p>Dear Sir</p>
            <p>Brokebill backed out from his trade - the reason he gave for it was that he was not able to
     get the money. I told him that he ought have told me that before we made the trade - he agreed
     to pay me twenty five dollars for my trouble and I let him off. I however sold the land in a
     few days afterwards to George <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">Woods</unclear>. I have
     got a little better trade with him than Brokebill - he will pay me three hundred dollars the
     1st of Jan</p>

            <p>What will I do with the money. Enclosed you will find a deed which Lizzie can sign and
     acknowledge according to former instructions. See that the Notary Public states &quot;with
     whome I am personally acquainted&quot;. Return it to me as soon as you can and I will <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">close</unclear> the trade at once I dont intend this to be a
     childs bargain - Sneed has gained his case and Crozier and Reynolds will both gain their cases
     as they are on the same principle - we expect to try both cases this court I fear we will not
     be able to try your cases or Macks</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="0012_000060_000226_0003.jpg" xml:id="d3e181"/>
            <p>this court. I have great confidence in gaining them as seom of the questions that are
     involved in Sneeds cases are also in yours. I received a long letter from Ma some time ago and
     intend to answer it after Court is over and I may be better <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">prepared</unclear> to answer it then than now. I however should think that as
     winter has not set in - it would be best not to return until Spring. We have no news of
     interest - all well - Love to all I have not the time to write you a longer letter</p>
            <p>Yours truly J.C. Ramsey</p>
