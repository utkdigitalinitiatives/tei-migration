               <note type="abstract">Arthur C. Crozier wrote this letter to his brother-in-law, J.G.M. Ramsey, on January 12, 1871. He mentioned one of Dr. Ramseyâ€™s law cases. He had no news about the Brakebill matter, but hoped that payment would be realized from it without a lawsuit. He told Ramsey of his future plans to move to a farm near Knoxville where he hoped to find some business, even though he was doubtful due to some conflicts in regards to a misunderstanding he&apos;d had with someone. </note>

            <p>Dr J.G. M Ramsey</p>
            <p>
               <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">Dr J - </unclear>
            </p>
            <p>I returned home last week - I did not see my prospect for business in that city - It required too much cash capital for me to go into my sort of business.</p>
            <p>The U.S. Court is in <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">session</unclear> now and John is very much engaged and I have not met with <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">McCormick </unclear> I will try &amp; see him to day and if I can get any information that will give me a hope of making a compromise with <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">Brownlow if</unclear>all your <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">cases</unclear>, I will try to go to Washington City - Mr Spence who promised to aid me in the matter is now in Washington &amp; will remain there during the winter. I will write him to day. In the mean time write me whatever you think would give my aid in the matter. </p>
            <p>John showed me your letter authorizing the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">dismissal</unclear>of the suit <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW"> sui</unclear> The Traders Bank &amp; myself. I am very much in hopes we can have them <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">dismissal</unclear> at the next term of the Court.</p>
            <p>I have not heard what was done with your Brakebill matter. I very</p>

            <p>much hope that the money can be <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">realized </unclear> without my suit. I am afraid my <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">Coations</unclear> in East Tennessee will not be satisfactory and that I shall have to <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">bemore </unclear> or at least remain away myself and try and get into business somewhere. I wrote you at one time about my misunderstanding with <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">Cre Deaderick </unclear>. I can see very plainly a great <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">castnop</unclear> on the part of the most of the family in <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">annyance</unclear> of this and it makes the place rather unpleasant. We will move to the place purchased by <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">Darthura</unclear> &amp; Margaret next week. It is 4 miles from town on the Clinton RR - contains 80 acres</p>
            <p>The boys still continue to have chills - <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">Dunlap</unclear> had one last night William has not had any for two weeks</p>
            <p>Love to all </p>
            <p>Yours truly</p>
