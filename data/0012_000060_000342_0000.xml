            <p>Dr Ramsey</p>
            <p>Sir</p>
            <p>Bugg has paid into my hands three hundred and sixty dollars to be applied on your note - He
says he will pay the ballance when the note is sent on - You had better send his note to me
and I will send you the money you can draw on me immediately for the $360 - Old Stephens is as
great a rascal as ever - I regret extremely that I was ordered to discontinue against him, as
a <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">Mr Castirs</unclear> has since obtained a judgment
against him and collected some hundred dollars, notwithstanding the old villain&apos;s attempts
to put his property into the hands of his son, who is a chip &amp;c I issued a writ of 
<unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">ejectment</unclear> against him as you ordered, but
he could not be found - I will catch him though, and will finally oust him, but I fear will never
get much money from him. I dare say he could pay in counterfeit money - He is a grand villain.
About a year since I went into Maury County and found Alexander - He is, as they say here,
mighty good for nothing - no chance of ever getting anything - He <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">denied</unclear> the account too - <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">Yrs &amp;c</unclear>
