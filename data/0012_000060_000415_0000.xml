               <note type="abstract">In a letter dated March 1, 1873, Dr. David Wills of Atlanta wrote to J.G.M. Ramsey in Knoxville, TN. Wills regretted that he did not see Ramsey in Greeneville at a ceremony in which a monument was erected in memory of Dr. Doak. Wills mentioned his speech and audience reaction. In his speech, he had spoken highly of Ramsey, of his gratitude to Ramsey for supplying him with facts for his speech, and also of educators, religion in Tennessee, and the first president of Washington, Greeneville, and Tusculum Colleges. Wills promised to send to Ramsey copies of his speech which would be published. He asked Ramsey to correct any errors in it. He also promised to recommend Ramsey for an LLD.</note>

            <p>My dear Friend.</p>
            <p>I greatly regret in not having met you at Greenville on the occasion of the erection of a monument to the memory of Dr. <unclear reason="illegible" resp="DV"> Doak </unclear> . There was a fine audience present &amp; all anticipated the pleasure of your presence &amp; of hearing you speak the words of &quot; truth &amp; <unclear reason="illegible" resp="DV"> soberness </unclear> &quot; . I could not tell when I would be at Knoxville or else I would have urged you to join me there. I looked for you when we reached the place, but could see nothing of you.</p>
            <p>I spoke about an hour &amp; a half &amp; had the best attention.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="0012_000060_000415_0003.jpg" xml:id="d3e195"/>
            <p>I gave prominence to the pioneers of education &amp; religion in Tenn &amp; first president of Washington, Greenville and Tusculum Colleges. I announced my indebtedness to you for interesting facts &amp; spoke of your life &amp; labors in a eulogistic manner. The address is to be published &amp; I will send you some copies. I would be glad for you to see the proof that you might correct any errors in dates &amp; c that might exist.</p>
            <p>
               <unclear reason="illegible" resp="DV"> Yrs </unclear> most sincerely</p>
            <p>David Wills</p>
            <p>P.S. I will recommend you for an L L D</p>
