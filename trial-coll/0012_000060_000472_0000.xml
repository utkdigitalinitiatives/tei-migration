            <p>Dr. J.G.M. Ramsey,</p>
            <p>Knoxville --</p>
            <p>Tennessee.</p>

            <p>Madison, Aug. 12nd 1880.</p>
            <p>My Dear Dr. Ramsey --</p>
            <p>Your favor of the 6th is at hand.</p>
            <p>I fear it would not be safe to infer that there was much of a part of Tennesseeans at the Cowpens. None of the printed accounts -- Judge Johnson, nor Graham&apos;s life of Morgan -- nor the unreliable acct. of Dr. S. L. Hammond in Johnson&apos;s Tradns. of the Revn., make any mention of Tennesseeans being there.</p>
            <p>Evan Shelby Jr., what I wrote you was there -- (on Geo. Wilson&apos;s authority, I think, I wrote you --see my letter of 2nd Aug to be certain) was the brother of Gc. &amp; Moses Shelby -- &amp; as Evan was a Major at King&apos;s Mountain,</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="0012_000060_000472_0003.jpg" xml:id="d3e179"/>
            <p>as the docs. in Shelby &amp; PReston controvesy show -- &amp; Moses then a Captain, so it would hardly do to make the latter the Senior. So if there was any command -- I doubt it -- Evan had the Seniority.</p>
            <p>In the accounts of the Cowpens, even Capt. Tate&apos;s command of Virginians is mentioned -- so, I think, if there had been any think like a company of Tennesseeans, they wd. have been mentioned somewhere. The little party of four -- with the possibility of a few associates, could only have been volunteers on their own look -- &amp; not enough of them to get any special notice. They, however, deserved it, for the distance they came.</p>
            <p>Pray, don&apos;t make too many of them.</p>
            <p>Very Truly Yours,</p>
            <p>Lyman C. Draper.</p>
            <p>You once wrote, in the goodness of your hears, for some data of my life. A friend &amp; neighbor, Prof. R.B. Anderson, of the State University &amp; distinguished as the writer on Norwegian literature has just written a sketch of me: But it may be sometime before it is in print.</p>
