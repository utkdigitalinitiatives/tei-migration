            <p>Madison July 31st 1878.</p>
            <p>My Dear Dr. Ramsey --</p>
            <p>It is too long since I have heard from you, that I must try to rouse you up. How comes on your History -- &amp; your Hist. Society? And last, not least, your health?</p>
            <p>I am plodding as usual -- gathering <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">spurfeeting,</unclear> in these hard times when publishers are so shy to undertake any thing unless the author will make sufficient <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">pecuniary</unclear> advances to indemnify them against loss. If profits shd. arise, they are quite ready to take them.</p>
            <p>But at last a young <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">Cini. pubr.</unclear> has consented to issue my Mecklenburg -- probably not till next spring. I must look it over &amp; make a few corrections, &amp; additions.</p>
            <p>I secured a publisher to take hold of my<unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">border forays</unclear> -- but that has since</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="0012_000060_000440_0002.jpg" xml:id="d3e184"/>
            <p>become paralyzed -- &amp; I know not whether he will recover sufficiently to go on with the work. As the contract is in writing, I am not at liberty to seek a new publisher.</p>
            <p>For the last year I have been mostly employed in gathering matter for a biography on Braul, the Mohawk Chief -- &amp; have been very successful. Stone&apos;s work, written 40 years ago, is full of <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">Enor,</unclear> -- since his day much new matter has been brought to light.</p>
            <p>On pp. 270-73, of yr. Annals, reference is made to Cherokee troubles in the Fall of 1782 -- of an intention on Gov. Martin&apos;s part to hold a treaty with them. (&amp; the Chickamauga -- as I learn from an unpublished doc -- of instructions to com., but without date) Was such a treaty held? In the instructions if is influential, that the Chickamauga still had their Colony -- &amp; shd. be made to return to the main nation. How is this?</p>
            <p>I trust you are in writing condition. May God spare you yet these many years -- as long as you can be useful, &amp; life desirable.</p>
            <p>Cordially &amp; Truly Yours,</p>
            <p>Lyman C. Draper</p>
            <p>If you have Wheeler&apos;s N.C. Hist. at hand, you will see, Vol. II, p. 56, reference to the appt. of the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">cour.</unclear> not in 1777 as he had it, Gov. Martin was not Gov till 1782 but evidentially in abt. Sept. 1782; &amp; not Gen. <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">John</unclear> McDowell, as Wheeler has it, but plainly Gen. Chs. McDowell.</p>
