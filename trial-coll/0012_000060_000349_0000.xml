            <p>P.S. If there is any Mourning <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">Grape</unclear> in any of the Stores
near you, will you please to take the earliest opportunity and get as many yards on my account as will make
a scarf for yourself - and each of my Brother-inlaws and Sister inlaws of which I consider the present Mrs
Caldwell one - and request them all to wear them awhile in rememberance of my Dear deceased wife - the amount
I will pay you for if Divine Providence permits me ever to see you again if not it can be transmitted to you - </p>
            <p>James <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">Cormer</unclear> Esquire of your County <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">calls</unclear> me for three years taxes I&apos;ve paid upon his 1000
acres of land in Anderson County. I have not time now to look at the Receipts and know the amount I have paid
for him - Your son in Duty and affection. F.A.R.</p>

            <p>You can all of you read jointly the letters I have addressed to each on this occasion, as I have tried
as much as my troubled mind would let me not to give quite the same information in each letter F.A.R.</p>
