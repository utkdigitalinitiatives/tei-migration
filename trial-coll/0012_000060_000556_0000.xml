            <p>Dear Mrs. Breck</p>
            <p>It has been some time since I wrote you. I thank you for the copy form your family bible. I am still much interested in your distinguished father and am very proud to be even distantly related to him I <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">have oflut mished</unclear>to know if pay for it.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="0012_000060_000556_0003.jpg" xml:id="d3e185"/>
            <p>he was a Confederate soldier? or was he too old to serve? I would like to know how he felt on this great question that caused such blood-shed in the <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">(61 &amp; 5)</unclear>, I have his annels of Tenn and enjoy reading the early Tenn, N.C. History. I hope I am not tresspassing to far to ask for his news and service in Civil war, I am studying him as a historic character and this is my plea of excuse for bothering you. We have a number of prominent people in Texas who claim descent from the Alexanders of N.C. some from John McKnitt.</p>

            <p>I hope you are strong and much improved in health. thanking you in advance for an early reply I am</p>
            <p>Sincerely Yours</p>
            <p>Mrs Oscar Barthold</p>
            <p>802 Waco St</p>
            <p>Have you a picture of your father if so what would be the cost in case you would allow such a distant <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">burroway</unclear>to have one I am very anxious for one and would gladly</p>
