            <p>Madison, Aug. 5th 1881</p>
            <p>My Dear Dr. Ramsey --</p>
            <p>Glad to receive your <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">Postal</unclear> card -- &amp; know that you are thinking of me -- &amp; that you are able to write to your friend.</p>
            <p>My work has eked out longer in time that I had supposed: But I have been very busy. The work is nearly all in type by this time -- though some 70 pages of proof or more yet to be read -- &amp; index made, which I am now engaged in.</p>
            <p>I should <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">guess</unclear>the volume <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">will be</unclear> out by 1st of Sept. -- as the covers are all made ready to put on -- &amp; a portion of the work printed.</p>
            <p>I had to <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">blur</unclear> over most of the the biographies -- save</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="0012_000060_000481_0003.jpg" xml:id="d3e195"/>
            <p>Campbell&apos;s, as chief commander &amp; Cleveland&apos;s as embracing many unpublished <unclear reason="illegible" resp="JR">Tory</unclear> incidents. Shelby &apos; Sevier, you know are pretty well written up in your Tennessee Histories, &amp; Shelby in <unclear reason="illegible" resp="bds">Ky</unclear> works. But on the whole, I hope you will not feel like finding fault.</p>
            <p>Those who complain of the delay will get a much better volume than they would had it appeared in the Spring or Early summer.</p>
            <p>My health is about as usual -- can work -- yet have not vigor enough to make work a pleasure -- I do it as a duty.</p>
            <p>A portion of our Summer has been very warm -- this month so far very oppressive.</p>
            <p>May Heaven Kindly bless you.</p>
            <p>Cordially &amp; Truly Yours,</p>
            <p>Lyman C. Draper</p>
