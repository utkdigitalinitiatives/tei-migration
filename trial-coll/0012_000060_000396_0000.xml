               <note type="abstract">Lyman C. Draper wrote to J.G.M. Ramsey on April 2, 1871 hoping the letter would get to him even though he wasn&apos;t sure Ramsey was in Charlotte. He mentioned that he had sent an excellent speech by a Judge Walker in pamphlet form to Ramsey. He told Ramsey he might not go through Knoxville on an upcoming trip. He said it would be out of his way, and he didn&apos;t know if the Sumpter descendants would know enough family history for it to be worth his while. He asked Ramsey to let him know if he was still in Charlotte. He also mentioned historical correspondence he was having with a Dr. Logan from Alabama.</note>

            <p>Madison, Wis, Apl. 2d 1871 </p>
            <p>My Dear Dr. Ramsey -</p>
            <p>I ought to have acknoledged yr. kind favor some time since. I doubt <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">pour wht.</unclear> you wrote me if this finds you at Charloote - if not, I hope it will follow you, if only to <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">showyou </unclear> that I do not forget you.</p>
            <p>I sent an excellent <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">serren</unclear> in pamphlet form, before our society, by Judge Walker, of Detroit - about as good a specimen of our Northern Christian Democratic scholars &amp; jurists as you will find. If it failed to reach you, let me know, &amp; I will try again. </p>
            <pb n="3" facs="0012_000060_000396_0003.jpg" xml:id="d3e195"/>
            <p>I dont get off on my journy yet - I do not see that I can till the 20th or later - so much to do. </p>
            <p>I am not at all certain that I shall go by way of Knoxville - itis so out of the way for the route I have marked out. A few of the descendants of Ms. Sumpter (as they spell their name) are yet in Knox Co- Tenne. - one of the old man&apos;s daughters is the wife of Capt. Jack Anderson - the rest fo the clan remaining <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">reside</unclear> some 12 ms north - <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">Baylers Marten </unclear>&amp; <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">Cline</unclear>: So <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">Kearn form Ees:</unclear>M. White- &amp; <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">fear form </unclear>wht. I learn that they know too little of their early family history to make it worth the while to go there.</p>
            <p>Do drop me a line that I may hear from you before my departure - so as to know if you are still at Charlotte - if so, how long you intend to remain</p>
            <p>May God &amp; the good guardian angels hover around, protect &amp; bless you &amp; yours! </p>
            <p>Faithfully <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">Feine</unclear>
            </p>
            <p>LymanC. Draper.</p>
            <p>I am doing well with my historical correspondence. Even Dr. Logan, of Alabama, has broken silence, &amp; writes me kind <unclear reason="illegible" resp="NW">frieanly</unclear> letters.- </p>
