            <p>Nashville, Tenn. Oct. 3rd, 1879</p>
            <p>Dr. J.G.M. Ramsey,</p>
            <p>Knoxville, Tenn.</p>
            <p>My Dear Sir:</p>
            <p>I have received the enclosed letter from D. Appleton &amp; Co. of New York, which please read and answer, or send an answer to me.</p>
            <p>Some illustrations are necessary, and indeed important. Also, some one ought to be employed, in New York, by the publisher, to place questions at the bottom of each page, for the Teacher to ask the Scholars, so as to make it a real school book, in attractive and saleable shape. I fear your manuscript is too full -- too lengthy -- for the purposes designed, and to bring it into popular use. Please preserve the letter, or return it to me, as you may deem best.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="0012_000060_000455_0002.jpg" xml:id="d3e165"/>
            <p>I did not Transmit your letter to me, to Appleton &amp; Co. because you mentioned them as being in Philadelphia, instead of New York, and because you said it would be a work of 800 pages, which I thought would deter them from making a proposition at all.</p>
            <p>The work ought not to be more than 400 pages, so as to make the price low and within reach of poor as well as rich scholars, all over the State.</p>
            <p>Very respectfully yours,</p>
            <p>Anson Nelson</p>
