# TEI Migration Project #

See [Project Proposal/Outline](https://wiki.lib.utk.edu/display/DLP/Proposal%3A+Start+Migration+of+TEI+collections+to+Exist+and+TEI+Publisher) and [JIRA DIT-1133](https://jira.lib.utk.edu/browse/DIT-1133).

## Test Data ##

See [DIT-1134](https://jira.lib.utk.edu/browse/DIT-1134).

I'm going to roll with the J. G. M. Ramsey Papers (MS.0253). It's a medium-sized collection made up of relatively simple/straight-forward transcription. See the sample data in [trial-coll](./trial-coll).

No TIFFs included in this repository.
